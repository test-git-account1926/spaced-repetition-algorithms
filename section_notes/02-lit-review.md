# Literature Review

## Summary

The spaced repetition literature spans over 140 years, from Ebbinghaus's foundational forgetting curve research (1885) to modern AI applications (2025). This comprehensive review of **15 key papers** identifies **three major evolutionary phases** and reveals critical **bit flips** driving algorithmic innovation across education, AI training, and cognitive systems.

**Phase 1: Foundational Psychology (1885-1985)** established exponential forgetting curves and the spacing effect. **Phase 2: Algorithmic Implementation (1985-2017)** developed practical systems like SuperMemo, progressing from simple E-Factors to sophisticated two-component memory models with mathematical optimization frameworks. **Phase 3: Universal Application (2017-2025)** demonstrates spaced repetition principles apply across all learning systems, from individual education to billion-parameter language models.

**Major 2025 Breakthrough**: Recent work validates that spaced repetition principles can reduce large language model training costs by **95%** while maintaining performance (LFR Pedagogy), enable **few-shot personalization** through biological memory principles (KUL-KT), and function as **universal optimization strategies** across all learning domains - confirming the literature-level bit flip hypothesis.
