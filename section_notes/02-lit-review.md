# Literature Review


## Summary

The spaced repetition literature spans over 140 years, from Ebbinghaus's foundational forgetting curve research (1885) to modern AI applications (2025). This comprehensive review of **16 key papers** identifies **three major evolutionary phases** and reveals critical **bit flips** driving algorithmic innovation across education, AI training, cognitive systems, and clinical applications.

**Phase 1: Foundational Psychology (1885-1985)** established exponential forgetting curves and the spacing effect. **Phase 2: Algorithmic Implementation (1985-2017)** developed practical systems like SuperMemo, progressing from simple E-Factors to sophisticated two-component memory models with mathematical optimization frameworks. **Phase 3: Universal Application (2017-2025)** demonstrates spaced repetition principles apply across all learning systems, from individual education to billion-parameter language models.

**Major 2025 Breakthrough**: Recent work validates that spaced repetition principles can reduce large language model training costs by **95%** while maintaining performance (LFR Pedagogy), enable **few-shot personalization** through biological memory principles (KUL-KT), enhance neural network training through strategic timing (Spaced KD), and function as **universal optimization strategies** across all learning domains - from clinical memory rehabilitation to large-scale AI training - confirming the literature-level bit flip hypothesis.

### Research Velocity Acceleration
The **19 validated bit flips** identified across 16 papers provide a structured foundation for the AI scientist to build upon, ensuring experiments target fundamental assumptions rather than incremental improvements. The progression from simple temporal spacing (1885) to universal learning optimization with clinical translation (2025) demonstrates clear evolutionary trajectories the AI scientist can explore.
