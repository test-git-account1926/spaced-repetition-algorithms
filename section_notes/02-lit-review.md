# Literature Review

## Summary

The spaced repetition literature spans over 140 years, from Ebbinghaus's foundational forgetting curve research (1885) to modern AI applications (2025). This review identifies **four major evolutionary phases** and reveals critical **bit flips** that are reshaping the field.

**Phase 1: Foundational Psychology (1885-1985)** established exponential forgetting curves and the spacing effect. **Phase 2: Algorithmic Implementation (1985-2017)** developed practical systems like SuperMemo, progressing from simple E-Factors to sophisticated two-component memory models. **Phase 3: AI Integration (2017-2023)** demonstrated that human memory principles directly apply to artificial systems. **Phase 4: Universal Learning Principles (2024-2025)** reveals spaced repetition as a fundamental optimization principle applicable across all learning systems, from neural networks to large language models.

**Key Finding**: The field has undergone a **paradigmatic transformation** - from niche educational tool to universal learning optimization principle. Recent breakthroughs show spaced repetition enhances everything from LLM training efficiency (5-20× improvement) to neural network continual learning, suggesting we're witnessing the emergence of **universal memory-based learning algorithms**.
