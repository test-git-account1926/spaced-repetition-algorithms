# Experiment Ideas

## Overview

This experimental program tests the **core bit flip**: that AI agents can autonomously discover spaced repetition algorithms that outperform human-designed methods by systematically exploring the algorithm design space. Our approach challenges three fundamental assumptions in the literature:

1. **Human expertise requirement**: Algorithm design requires domain expert knowledge
2. **Near-optimality assumption**: Existing algorithms are close to optimal
3. **Universal approach assumption**: One-size-fits-all algorithms work best

## Experimental Strategy

**Core Thesis**: An AI scientist equipped with simulation environments, evaluation frameworks, and iterative optimization can discover novel spaced repetition algorithms that achieve superior performance across multiple dimensions (retention efficiency, learner burden, domain generalization).

**Validation Approach**: Compare AI-discovered algorithms against established baselines using rigorous simulation studies with statistical validation, followed by human validation studies.
