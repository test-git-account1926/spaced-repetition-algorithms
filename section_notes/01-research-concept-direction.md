# Research Concept & Direction

The spaced repetition literature spans over 140 years, from Ebbinghaus's foundational forgetting curve research (1885) to modern AI applications (2025). This comprehensive review of 35 key papers identifies three major evolutionary phases and reveals critical bit flips driving algorithmic innovation across education, AI training, cognitive systems, clinical applications, and emerging areas including conversational learning, real-time adaptation, and control-theoretic optimization.
