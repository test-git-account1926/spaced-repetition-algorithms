# Experiment Plan: Adaptive Algorithm Personalization Discovery

## Bit Flip
**Bit**: One-size-fits-all spaced repetition algorithms work optimally  
**Flip**: AI can discover meta-algorithms achieving superior personalization beyond parameter tuning

## Hypothesis
AI-discovered adaptive algorithms will achieve â‰¥20% retention improvement over fixed algorithms by learning individual memory signatures and dynamically adjusting strategies.

## Experimental Design

### Phase 1: Diverse Learner Generation
- Create 200 synthetic learners with varying cognitive profiles
- Parameters: memory strength, forgetting rates, consistency, domain expertise
- Learning profiles: fast/slow learners, consistent/inconsistent, domain specialists

### Phase 2: Meta-Learning Algorithm Discovery  
- Implement neural network meta-learners for pattern recognition
- Evolve meta-algorithm architectures balancing personalization vs efficiency
- Population size: 50 meta-algorithms
- Generations: 20 evolutionary iterations

### Phase 3: Validation and Analysis
- Cross-learner generalization testing with holdout validation
- Fairness analysis across learner types
- Interpretability analysis for educational applications

## Expected Outcomes
- Discovery of 2-4 distinct personalization strategies
- Significant improvement for bottom quartile learners  
- Universal vs personal optimization principles identification

## Risk Mitigation
- Include diverse learner models to prevent overfitting
- Implement fairness constraints and bias testing
- Real-world validation considerations

## Timeline
Simplified for current implementation: 2-3 hours for proof of concept
