# Dynamic Cheatsheet: Test-Time Learning with Adaptive Memory (2025)

## CS197 Analysis

### Problem
Current language models process each query independently without retaining insights from previous problem-solving attempts, leading to repeated mistakes and inefficient problem-solving that doesn't improve over time.

### Prior Assumptions
- Stateless query processing is optimal for language model inference
- Each problem should be solved from scratch without memory
- Fine-tuning is the only way to improve model performance
- Test-time learning requires ground-truth labels or human feedback

### Insight (Bit Flip)
**From stateless to persistent memory**: Language models can dramatically improve through test-time learning by maintaining a dynamic, evolving memory of successful strategies and solutions without requiring explicit labels.

### Technical Overview
- **Persistent Memory System**: Lightweight framework that maintains evolving memory across inference sessions
- **Self-Curated Memory**: Automatically identifies and stores concise, transferable insights rather than entire transcripts
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Updates problem-solving strategies based on success patterns without parameter modifications
- **Code Snippet Reuse**: Stores and reapplies validated code solutions across similar problems

### Evaluation
**Dramatic Performance Gains**:
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: >2× accuracy improvement on AIME math exams
- **GPT-4o Game of 24**: 10% → 99% success rate after discovering Python solution
- **Equation Balancing**: Near-perfect accuracy vs. 50% baseline through validated code reuse
- **Knowledge Tasks**: 9% improvement on GPQA-Diamond, 8% boost on MMLU-Pro

### Impact
1. **Paradigm Shift**: Demonstrates persistent memory can enhance LMs without parameter changes
2. **Test-Time Learning**: Validates learning during inference without explicit supervision
3. **Cumulative Intelligence**: Shows how models can build upon previous problem-solving experiences
4. **Efficiency Gains**: Achieves major improvements with minimal computational overhead

## Key Technical Components

### Memory Architecture
- **Strategy Storage**: Maintains successful problem-solving approaches
- **Code Repository**: Validated code snippets for reuse across similar problems
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies transferable insights from successful solutions
- **Dynamic Retrieval**: Context-aware memory access during inference

### Self-Curation Mechanism
- Automatically extracts concise, transferable knowledge
- Filters out irrelevant or incorrect information
- Maintains memory size within practical limits
- Updates based on success/failure patterns

## Research Implications

### Bit Flip Analysis
**Assumption**: Language models should process queries independently for optimal performance
**Flip**: Persistent memory across queries enables cumulative learning and dramatic performance improvements
**Evidence**: Multiple order-of-magnitude improvements across diverse task domains

### Applications Beyond Problem-Solving
1. **Scientific Research**: Accumulating insights across research papers
2. **Code Development**: Building library of tested solutions and patterns
3. **Educational Tutoring**: Adapting to individual student learning patterns
4. **Creative Writing**: Maintaining consistency and building on previous work

## Connection to Spaced Repetition
Dynamic Cheatsheet implements implicit spaced repetition principles:
- **Selective Rehearsal**: Frequently accessed strategies become more readily available
- **Adaptive Scheduling**: Important solutions resurface when contextually relevant
- **Memory Consolidation**: Successful patterns strengthen through repeated success

## Research Questions for AI Scientist
1. How can spaced repetition principles optimize memory curation in Dynamic Cheatsheet?
2. What scheduling algorithms determine when to retrieve vs. create new solutions?
3. How does memory size affect the trade-off between storage and retrieval efficiency?
4. Can semantic clustering improve memory organization and retrieval?

## Methodological Innovation
- **No Parameter Changes**: Demonstrates improvement without fine-tuning or retraining
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Self-improvement without explicit labels
- **Lightweight Implementation**: Minimal computational and memory overhead
- **Transferable Framework**: Applicable across different model architectures
