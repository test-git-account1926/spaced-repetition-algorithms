## CS197 Analysis Framework

### Problem
Knowledge Components (KCs) are essential for modeling student learning and enabling personalized education, but manual KC creation and problem tagging by domain experts is extremely labor-intensive and doesn't scale to modern educational platforms.

### Prior Assumptions in Literature
- Human domain experts required for accurate KC generation and tagging
- Automated approaches cannot match expert-level KC quality
- KCs must be manually crafted for each new problem domain
- Human-written KCs are inherently superior for learning modeling

### Key Insight
**LLM-based automated KC generation can outperform human experts** in both quality and learning model performance while eliminating labor-intensive manual processes.

### Technical Approach
**KCGen-KT Framework:**
1. **Automated KC Generation**: LLM-based pipeline for generating knowledge components for programming problems
2. **Automated KC Tagging**: LLM mapping of problems to relevant knowledge components  
3. **LLM-based Knowledge Tracing**: KT framework leveraging LLM-generated KCs

**Implementation:**
- End-to-end automated pipeline from problem description to KC assignment
- LLM prompt engineering for domain-specific KC generation
- Integration with existing KT architectures
- Cognitive model validation of generated KCs

### Evaluation
- **Dataset**: Real-world student code submission data
- **Comparison**: LLM-generated vs. human-written KCs
- **Metrics**: Future student response prediction accuracy, learning curve fit
- **Qualitative**: Human evaluation with course instructors
- **Results**: KCGen-KT outperforms existing KT methods and human-written KCs

**Key Finding**: LLM-generated KCs result in better fit under cognitive models than human-written KCs

### Impact and Significance
**Bit Flip**: **Automated AI-generated knowledge components can surpass human expert performance**

**Impact:**
- Eliminates bottleneck of manual KC creation in educational technology
- Enables rapid deployment of personalized learning systems to new domains
- Challenges assumption that human expertise is irreplaceable in educational design
- Provides scalable solution for massive open online courses

### Research Relevance
This work demonstrates a critical **automation bit flip** where AI systems not only match but exceed human expert performance in educational content design. This has profound implications for scaling personalized education.

**Connection to AI Scientist Research**: Shows how AI can automate the knowledge engineering process that traditionally required human experts, potentially enabling the AI scientist to automatically generate its own knowledge representations for spaced repetition experiments.

**Educational Scalability**: Removes the primary barrier to deploying sophisticated knowledge tracing systems at scale, enabling personalized learning for millions of students without proportional increases in human expert time.

**Quality Validation**: The finding that automated KCs outperform human-written ones in cognitive model fit suggests AI may have superior consistency and comprehensiveness in knowledge decomposition.
