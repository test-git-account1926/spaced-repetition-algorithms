# Survey of Loss Augmented Knowledge Tracing (2025)

## CS197 Analysis Framework

### Problem
Traditional loss functions like cross-entropy and MSE often fail to address challenges in knowledge tracing due to data quality limitations and learning process inefficiencies, limiting model performance and robustness in educational prediction tasks.

### Prior Assumptions in Prior Work
- Standard loss functions (cross-entropy, MSE) are sufficient for knowledge tracing
- Simple supervised learning approaches can adequately capture student learning patterns
- Loss function design is not a primary factor in KT model performance
- Contrastive learning techniques are not applicable to educational sequence modeling
