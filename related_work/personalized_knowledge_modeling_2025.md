# Personalized Student Knowledge Modeling for Future Learning Resource Prediction (2025)

## CS197 Analysis Framework

### Problem
Student knowledge tracing and behavior modeling suffer from limited personalization, inadequate modeling of diverse learning activities (especially non-assessed materials), and failure to capture the interplay between knowledge acquisition and behavioral patterns, resulting in poor prediction of future learning preferences.

### Prior Assumptions in Prior Work
- Fixed-size sequence segmentation is adequate despite losing contextual information
- Performance on assessed materials is sufficient for modeling student learning
- Knowledge acquisition and behavioral patterns can be modeled independently
- Uniform student treatment without personalized profiling is effective

### Insight
Personalized student representations through clustering-based profiling, combined with multi-task modeling of both knowledge and behavior, can simultaneously improve knowledge tracing and predict future learning resource preferences while addressing sequence segmentation limitations.

### Technical Overview
**KMaP (Knowledge Modeling and Material Prediction)** Framework:
- **Stateful architecture** that maintains persistent student state across sessions
- **Clustering-based student profiling** for personalized representations
- **Multi-task learning** for simultaneous knowledge tracing and behavior prediction
- **Non-assessed material integration** including lectures and supplementary content
- **Dynamic sequence handling** without fixed segmentation constraints

### Proof/Evaluation
- Extensive experiments on two real-world educational datasets
- Demonstrates significant behavioral differences across student clusters
- Validates efficacy of KMaP model for both knowledge tracing and resource prediction
- Shows improved personalization through cluster-based student modeling

### Impact
- **Bit Flip**: Uniform student modeling â†’ Personalized clustering-based representations dramatically improve both knowledge tracing and behavioral prediction
- Addresses fundamental limitations of fixed sequence segmentation in educational modeling
- Enables modeling of diverse learning activities beyond traditional assessment data
- Demonstrates multi-task learning effectiveness for educational prediction tasks

### CS197 Significance
This work challenges the assumption that student knowledge and behavior can be effectively modeled through uniform approaches, showing that personalized clustering and multi-task architectures are necessary for comprehensive educational modeling that includes both assessed and non-assessed learning activities.
