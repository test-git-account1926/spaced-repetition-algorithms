## CS197 Analysis Framework

### Problem
Existing spaced repetition algorithms fail to address **semantic interference** in vocabulary learning, particularly in test-oriented scenarios (TOEFL, IELTS, GRE). Traditional algorithms like SM2, HLR, and FSRS treat each item in isolation, leading to confusion between semantically similar concepts and decreased retention rates.

### Prior Assumptions in Literature
- **Assumption**: Items can be scheduled independently without considering semantic relationships
- **Assumption**: Temporal spacing alone is sufficient for optimal learning
- **Assumption**: One-size-fits-all algorithms work across all learning domains
- **Inadequacy**: These assumptions ignore the critical role of semantic interference in vocabulary acquisition

### Key Insight (Bit Flip)
**The Flip**: Integration of large language models (LLMs) for **semantic similarity assessment** with personalized learning profiles can address semantic confusion while maintaining established spaced repetition principles.

**Novel Contribution**: LECTOR leverages LLMs to analyze semantic relationships between learning items and adjusts scheduling accordingly, particularly targeting test-oriented learning scenarios.

### Technical Approach
1. **Semantic Analysis**: Uses LLMs for few-shot semantic similarity assessment
2. **Personalized Adaptation**: Incorporates individual learning profiles 
3. **Test-Oriented Focus**: Specifically designed for examination success rates
4. **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines LLM-powered semantic analysis with traditional spaced repetition algorithms

### Evaluation
- **Comparison**: Against 6 baseline algorithms (SSP-MMC, SM2, HLR, FSRS, ANKI, THRESHOLD)
- **Scale**: 100 simulated learners over 100 days
- **Metrics**: Success rate, semantic confusion reduction, computational efficiency
- **Results**: 90.2% success rate vs 88.4% for best baseline (SSP-MMC) - 2.0% relative improvement

### Impact and Implications
- **Immediate**: Demonstrates measurable improvement in handling semantically similar concepts
- **Broader**: Opens new research direction for semantic-aware spaced repetition
- **Applications**: Promising for intelligent tutoring systems and adaptive learning platforms
- **Research Direction**: Bridges classical memory research with modern NLP capabilities

## Research Gaps Identified
- Limited evaluation on real-world data (only simulated learners)
- Focus primarily on vocabulary learning - generalization unclear
- Computational overhead of LLM integration not thoroughly analyzed
- Long-term retention effects beyond 100 days unknown

## Relevance to Current Research
This paper directly addresses the **semantic interference problem** that could be a key research gap in current spaced repetition literature. The integration of LLMs represents a novel approach that could inspire new algorithmic families.
