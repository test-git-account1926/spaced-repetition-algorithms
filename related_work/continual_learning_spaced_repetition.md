## Task-Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall (TFC-SR) - Bamnodkar (2025)

**ArXiv**: 2507.21109  
**Published**: July 2025  

### CS197 Analysis
**Problem**: Catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks when learning sequential tasks

**Prior Assumptions**: 
- Experience replay alone is sufficient for continual learning
- Random sampling from memory buffer is optimal
- Active recall mechanisms from human learning don't apply to neural networks

**Key Insight**: Integration of **Active Recall, Deliberate Practice, and Spaced Repetition** from human learning can enhance experience replay through periodic, task-aware memory evaluation.

**Technical Approach**: 
- Active Recall Probe: Periodic evaluation of model's memory
- Task-aware memory stabilization 
- Enhanced experience replay with spaced review scheduling

**Evaluation**: 
- Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks
- TFC-SR: 13.17% vs Standard Replay: 7.40% on Split CIFAR-100
- Better performance in memory-constrained environments

## View-Batch Model - Kang et al. (2025)

**ArXiv**: 2503.18371v1  
**Authors**: Hankyul Kang, Gregor Seifer, Donghyun Lee, Jongbin Ryu  

### CS197 Analysis
**Problem**: Continual learning systems don't leverage Ebbinghaus forgetting curve theory for optimal memory retention

**Prior Assumptions**:
- Learning schedules in neural networks don't need to follow human memory principles
- Batch learning and review timing are independent optimization problems
- Sufficient rest periods are unnecessary for neural network learning

**Key Insight**: **Forgetting curve theory** suggests learning extensive data requires sufficient rest before relearning - this can optimize neural network continual learning.

**Technical Approach**:
1. Replay method guaranteeing optimal recall intervals
2. Self-supervised learning acquiring extensive knowledge from single samples
3. View-batch model adjusting learning schedules based on recall intervals

**Evaluation**: Significantly improves state-of-the-art continual learning methods across various protocols

## Task Scheduling & Forgetting in Multi-Task RL - Speckmann & Eimer (2016/2025)

**ArXiv**: 2503.01941v1  
**Authors**: Marc Speckmann, Theresa Eimer  

### CS197 Analysis  
**Problem**: RL agents exhibit forgetting when learning multiple tasks, but human-inspired scheduling methods aren't well-studied in RL contexts

**Prior Assumptions**:
- Performance-based curriculum scheduling is optimal for RL
- Human learning theory doesn't apply to reinforcement learning
- Forgetting in RL follows different patterns than human forgetting

**Key Insight**: **RL agents exhibit human-like forgetting curves**, enabling application of Leitner and SuperMemo systems to RL task scheduling.

**Technical Approach**:
- Applied Leitner and SuperMemo scheduling to MiniGrid tasks
- Compared with Prioritized Level Replay (PLR)
- Analyzed asymmetrical learning and retention patterns

**Evaluation**: Found RL forgetting curves similar to humans, but traditional spaced repetition methods don't transfer as effectively due to asymmetrical task patterns

## Common Themes Across Papers

### Shared Bit Flip
**Traditional Assumption**: Artificial learning systems require fundamentally different approaches than human learning  
**New Understanding**: **Human memory principles directly apply to artificial systems** and can improve performance

### Technical Convergence
1. **Memory Consolidation**: All papers emphasize importance of memory stabilization periods
2. **Spaced Review**: Optimal timing of review sessions critical for retention  
3. **Individual Adaptation**: Systems must adapt to specific learning patterns
4. **Forgetting Curve Alignment**: Neural networks can exhibit human-like forgetting patterns

### Research Gaps Identified
- Limited theoretical understanding of why these principles transfer
- Most evaluations on simplified benchmarks rather than complex real-world tasks
- Computational overhead analysis often missing
- Long-term retention studies rare

## Impact on Current Research Direction

These papers collectively establish that **spaced repetition principles are broadly applicable to artificial learning systems**, not just human learning. This opens multiple research directions:

1. **Cross-domain Application**: Principles discovered in one area (RL, continual learning, NLP) may transfer broadly
2. **Theoretical Foundation**: Need for deeper understanding of why human memory principles work in artificial systems  
3. **Algorithmic Innovation**: Opportunity for new hybrid algorithms combining multiple cognitive principles
4. **Evaluation Standards**: Need for standardized metrics comparing artificial and human-like learning curves
