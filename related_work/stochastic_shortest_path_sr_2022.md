## CS197 Analysis Framework

### Problem
- **What problem is being solved?** Existing spaced repetition schedulers lack guaranteed optimization for review cost minimization and don't effectively model students' long-term memory with time-series features
- **Why does it matter?** Inefficient scheduling leads to suboptimal learning outcomes and wasted study time for millions of language learning students

### Prior Assumptions (Bit to Flip)
- **Assumption in prior work**: Heuristic-based scheduling approaches are sufficient for spaced repetition optimization
- **Why was it inadequate?** No theoretical guarantees for optimality and limited use of rich behavioral data available in modern learning platforms

### Insight (The Flip)
- **Novel idea**: Model memory behavior with Markov property using massive behavioral datasets, then apply stochastic shortest path algorithms to guarantee optimal review cost minimization
- **What breaks from assumption**: Replaces heuristic approaches with mathematically principled optimization backed by large-scale empirical data

### Technical Approach
- **How was insight implemented**: 
  - Collected 220 million student memory behavior logs with time-series features
  - Built memory model with Markov property from this massive dataset
  - Designed stochastic shortest path algorithm guaranteed to minimize review cost
  - Deployed in production MaiMemo app serving millions of users

### Evaluation
- **How was insight validated**: 
  - 12.6% performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods
  - Real-world deployment validation with millions of users
  - Demonstrated both theoretical optimality guarantees and practical effectiveness

### Impact
- **Implications**: First spaced repetition scheduler with mathematical optimality guarantees backed by massive-scale empirical validation
- **How will it change the field**: Shifts from heuristic to principled optimization approaches with proven real-world scalability

## Bit Flip Identification

**Bit**: Spaced repetition scheduling can rely on heuristic approaches without formal optimization guarantees
