### Problem
Traditional loss functions (cross-entropy, MSE) while broadly applicable, often fall short in knowledge tracing due to data quality limitations and learning process inefficiencies. Standard loss functions don't account for the unique characteristics of educational data and learning dynamics, leading to suboptimal model performance and robustness.

### Assumption in Prior Work
- Standard loss functions (cross-entropy, MSE) sufficient for educational modeling
- Loss function selection not critical for knowledge tracing performance
- Single loss objective adequate for complex educational dynamics
- Generic optimization approaches work well for personalized learning

### Insight (Bit Flip)
**Loss function augmentation through regularization and contrastive learning** significantly enhances knowledge tracing model capacity, performance, and robustness. The key insight is that educational data requires specialized loss function designs that account for temporal dependencies, individual differences, and learning-specific constraints.

### Technical Overview
The survey covers two main augmentation approaches:

1. **Loss Regularization Techniques**:
   - Additional terms to address data quality issues
   - Regularization for learning process efficiency
   - Domain-specific constraints for educational contexts
   - Robustness improvements through specialized penalties

2. **Contrastive Learning Methods**:
   - Bi-CLKT: Bidirectional contrastive learning
   - CL4KT: Contrastive learning for knowledge tracing
   - SP-CLKT: Self-paced contrastive learning
   - CoSKT: Collaborative self-supervised knowledge tracing
   - Prediction-consistent DKT variants

3. **Advanced Techniques**:
   - Performance benchmarks across methods
   - Real-world deployment challenges
   - Hybrid loss strategies
   - Context-aware modeling approaches
